# About me


**GabrielWSchneider/GabrielWSchneider** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub and Markdown!  <!-- Should update this line in a few weeks (from 7/17/25) -->
- 🎮 Ask me about my 3 favorite games of all time!
- 😄 Pronouns: "They/them" encouraged but not required.
- ⚡ Fun fact: "Bufo bufo" is the latin name for the common toad, native to Europe. "Beelzebufo ampinga" is the latin name of one of the largest prehistoric frogs ever discovered.
